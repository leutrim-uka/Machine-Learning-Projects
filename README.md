<h3>Digit recognizer with Feed-Forward NNs and CNNs</h3>
This is the classical computer vision task, in which we recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
The solution is built using Keras (for the Feed-Forward NNs) and PyTorch (for the CNNs) <br/>

<h3>Simple Autoencoder</h3>
In this project, I implemented a simple autoencoder architecture using convolutional layers and trained it on the MNIST dataset. The encoder part of the network
compresses the images by lowering the resolution layer by layer until it reaches the bottleneck. The decoder part then attempts to reconstruct the image back to 
the original resolution, but it introduces some blurriness.
